<h2>What is an Arctic Wolf?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/wildlife/Arctic_animals/arctic_wolf.php" target="_blank">Arctic Wolf</a>, also known as the <b>White wolf</b> or <b>Polar wolf</b>, is a subspecies of grey wolf native to Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands, from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island. Thanks to its isolation, the Arctic wolf is not threatened by hunting and habitat destruction in the same way as its southern relatives. Arctic wolves have white fur, which helps them blend in with the snowy environment around them. Compared to other subspecies of wolves, they have smaller ears, shorter legs, and smaller muzzles. Their fur, however, is dense and long in comparison to other subspecies.</p>

<h2>Why is this animal considered endangered?</h2>
<p>The reason for their endangerment is <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Global Warming.</a>  Arctic Hares and Muskox (some of their prey) have lost their food sources due to global warming. With fewer of these animals to eat, Arctic Wolves have smaller food sources, which has led to their endangerment</p>

<h2>Why they are important to the ecosystem? </h2>
<p>Arctic wolves are <a href="https://www.torontozoo.com/animals/Arctic%20wolf#:~:text=They%20are%20predatory%20carnivores.,small%20animals%20including%20nesting%20birds." target="_blank">carnivorous hunters.</a> By nature they help to control the populations of other animals in the region like the musk ox, caribou and Arctic hares. Wolves play a key role in keeping ecosystems healthy. They help keep deer and elk populations in check, which can benefit many other plant and animal species. The carcasses of their prey also help to redistribute nutrients and provide food for other wildlife species, like grizzly bears and scavengers.</p>
